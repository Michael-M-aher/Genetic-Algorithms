## Brief

This repository provides Python implementations of genetic algorithms for solving two distinct problems: curve fitting and the knapsack problem. Genetic algorithms are employed to find optimal solutions in both scenarios.

### [Knapsack Problem](https://github.com/Michael-M-aher/Genetic-Algorithms/blob/main/knapsack)

The knapsack problem solver employs a genetic algorithm to maximize the total value of selected items placed in a knapsack, considering the weight capacity of the knapsack.

### [Curve Fitting](https://github.com/Michael-M-aher/Genetic-Algorithms/blob/main/curve_fitting)

The curve fitting algorithm aims to find the best coefficients for a polynomial equation, minimizing the distance between the curve and a given set of data points.

## Installation

To use the algorithms in this repository, you will need Python 3 installed on your system. You can download Python 3 from the official website: [Python Downloads](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

Once you have Python 3 installed, you can run the programs for curve fitting and the knapsack problem.
